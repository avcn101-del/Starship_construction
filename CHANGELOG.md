# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-20 — review roles

- Decisions #167–#168: four roles (lead designer, engineer, reviewer,
  physics checker), each its own session, handing over through pull
  requests; a retroactive review of L0.
- Role definitions in `.claude/agents/`; `CLAUDE.md` gains a Roles section.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-20 — Mission 0, L0 materials

- Decisions #163–#166: SI units, the eight Mission 0 exit criteria, the L0
  plan (sectional-momentum penetration, Gaussian beams) and its ranges.
- `tools/m0.js`: the Mission 0 runner (run, lock, verify, regress, ledger).
  Criteria are hashed and locked; overrides are exploratory and refused
  outside approved ranges; records carry the command that reproduces them.
- Kernel for L0: `js/util.js`, `js/data.js`, `js/projectile.js`,
  `js/damage.js`, `js/field.js`.
- Seven L0 scenarios, locked before their first run; all PASS and verify.
- Measured in `DESIGN.md` §16; constants awaiting approval in §17.

## 0.0.0 — 2026-10-20 — the design

- The design discussion is recorded in `DECISIONS.md` (#1–#162).
- Base documents written from it: `DESIGN.md` (the current design),
  `CLAUDE.md` (working rules), `IDEAS.md` (the idea registry), `README.md`,
  `MISSION0.md` (the empty results ledger).
- No code yet. The next step is Mission 0, level L0, after its exit
  criteria and its approved ranges are agreed (`DESIGN.md` §17).
